###FEATURES

&#9658; **Auto-Select 5 Stars**: Optionally prefill the rating with 5 stars while allowing customers to adjust as needed.

&#9658; **Auto-Fill Review Content**: Predefine a default review message (e.g., "Excellent product, highly recommended!") that appears in the review input field, which users can edit or remove.

&#9658; **Canned reviews**: Pre-written feedback that can be quickly inserted into a text field, reducing the need for users to type out a response manually.

- Build a list of predefined review content.

- Display your list of canned reviews as a dropdown or slider below the review form.

- Customize canned reviews appearance with text and background color, in default status or on hover

&#9658; **Purchased label**: Display a "Purchased" label when a review is submitted.

- Select an icon for the label.

- Customize its appearance to align with your store’s branding, including icon color, text color, and background color.
